              Inspired by Adam Wathan, Wes Bos, Freek Murze and many others,
              I've put together this list of hardware, software and services
              that I use to get shit done. This list updated as my workflow and
              equipment evolves.

                Being both and avid gamer and developer, my setup is a nice mix
                from both worlds. Curious about what parts are in my build?

                Because I need to have access to my computer wherever I work, I
                was looking for a small laptop for the portability and the 13"
                MacBook fit the bill at the time. Due to the world getting
                turned upside down from COVID-19, this will likely be my last
                laptop for a while since I am now working fully remote.

                Once I went ultrawide I absolutely fell in love with the 21:9
                format. It may seem like a small thing but being able to have a
                browser and your code side-by-side on the same monitor is one of
                those things you don't realize you want until you have it. So of
                course I bought a second.

                  Realforce RGB Topre Mechanical Keyboard (80% layout)

              <br />
              <br />
              <p>
                Having tried 11 different keyboards and counting so far, my
                favorite has to be my Realforce RGB; it's an absolute joy to
                use. If you've never typed on a keyboard with Topre key
                switches, I highly recommend if you're a fan of Cherry MX
                Browns. They are similar but Topre switches feel like more of a
                snap on actuation rather than a bump.

              <p>
                Visual Studio Code is the defacto code editor for web
                developers. However since it is a Microsoft product, the
                official VSCode releases are packed with telemetry/tracking.
                Since I'm not a huge fan of that, VSCodium builds from the
                source repo and doesn't include that shady tracking Microsoft
                throws in.

              <br />
              <p>
                I really don't like the default Windows Command Prompt. Call me
                petty but I think it's incredibly ugly to look at, even after
                customizing the colors. After some digging, I stumbled upon
                Terminus and couldn't be happier. It's extremely customizable
                and very flexible with different shell types.

                <strong>GitKraken - Git Client GUI</strong>

              <br />
              <p>
                I'm one of <em>those</em> people who use a GUI for all of my Git
                needs. GitKraken is by far my favorite in terms of user
                interface of any git client I've seen before. It's completely
                free for FLOSS projects, but their paid tier is absolutely worth
                the price.

              <p>
                Honestly the justification is pretty simple for me - I just find
                the integrated dev tools to be much more powerful in Firefox
                over Chrome. That being said, I still use both on a daily basis
                for both work and play.
